      'Before the vows, before the plans, before we even realized how deeply our lives would intertwine — there was this spark. Soft laughter, shy glances, and a quiet knowing in my heart that something extraordinary had begun. Those moments weren’t just captured in photos… they were the universe gently introducing me to my forever.',

      'Amid sacred chants, the warmth of the agni, and the rhythm of ancient vows, we took our sapthapadi — seven steps into one shared life. With every blessing and every smile around us, I wasn’t just marrying you; I was stepping into a lifelong journey as your partner, your supporter, your equal. That moment didn’t just unite us — it gave my heart its truest sense of belonging.',

Watching you step into parenthood filled me with awe; your strength, your tenderness, your endless care… it made me fall for you in brand-new ways. Our home gained toys on the floor, laughter in the air, and a joy that multiplied beyond measure.',

Whether it was grand adventures or quiet stolen moments, each journey became special because you were there. You’re my favorite co-conspirator, my navigator through life, and the destination I’d choose every single time.',

We’re still writing it together.',
